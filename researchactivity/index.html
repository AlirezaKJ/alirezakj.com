            <h2>Coding A Website</h2>
            <p>
                As a start to coding a website you need to learn HTML and CSS to create a static website which doesn’t have any real functionality and you can just adjust the design of it after that you will learn JavaScript to handle different actions and events happening in your website.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you completely learned the above skills, you know the basics of web development and you start to learn a Back-End language to handle different URLs and data in your website (example: login and signup functionality, making a database), in 2023 most of people use Next.js framework for their Back-End environment because its easy to learn and it’s on the JavaScript which means you don’t need to learn another coding language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other popular Back-End frameworks are Flask and Django. Both are on python language which is an easy to learn Coding Language and have a huge community to help you out on your work

            <p>
                Mostly peoples who don’t want to spend a lot of time on making a website use a CMS to quickly create their favourite website behind a template, WordPress is one of the most popular CMS that most people still use it but after 2020 a lot of people use different CMS especially if they are making an e-commerce (business) website because WordPress was getting a bit old and it’s on PHP language mainly which is a really slow compared to other languages, some of the most used CMS these days are Shopify, Wix and Magento
